# Overview

Trying to learn how to use Android Studio with the Kotlin language

It's a simple To-Do list that I will use to keep track of the exercises I do at the Gym. 

The purpose is to practice with Kotlin with a basic funciton but then later expand to include saving routines keeping track of weights and reps etc. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}
